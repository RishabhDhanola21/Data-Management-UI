📊 Data Management Table App
Welcome to your very own spreadsheet-like data editor — built with modern web tools like React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and react-table. Whether you're managing tasks, tracking submissions, or just playing with tabular data, this app makes it smooth, editable, and kind of fun.

🚀 What You Can Do
✍️ Edit on the Fly
Just click any cell — type what you need — hit blur or tab. That’s it.

➕ Add Custom Columns
Got something new to track? Add as many columns as you want, dynamically.

📈 More Rows? Keep Scrolling
Infinite scroll-style — the table grows as you scroll down. No reloads, no clicks.

🎯 Filter by Status
Need to focus on just "In-process" or "Blocked" items? Filter tabs help you zoom in instantly.

💅 Clean and Responsive Design
Thanks to Tailwind CSS, it looks neat out of the box — on desktops and smaller screens too.

🧠 TypeScript All the Way
It’s strongly typed — so fewer surprises and better editor support.

🧱 Under the Hood
This project is powered by:

⚛️ React 18

📘 TypeScript (strict mode)

⚡ Vite (fast builds, fast reloads)

💨 Tailwind CSS (for styling)

🧩 react-table (for flexible table rendering)
