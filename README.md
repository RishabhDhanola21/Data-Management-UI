Data Management Table App
Welcome to your very own spreadsheet-like data editor — built with modern web tools like React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and react-table. Whether you're managing tasks, tracking submissions, or just playing with tabular data, this app makes it smooth, editable, and easy to use.

What You Can Do
Edit on the Fly
Just click any cell, type what you need, and move on. Edits happen inline and feel instant.

Add Custom Columns
Need to track something new? You can add columns dynamically with a simple click.

More Rows? Keep Scrolling
This app supports infinite scroll — as you scroll down, more rows appear automatically.

Filter by Status
Use the footer tabs to filter and focus on orders like "In-process", "Complete", or "Blocked".

Clean and Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS ensures everything looks clean and adjusts well across devices.

TypeScript All the Way
Fully type-safe with strict mode enabled, so you get fewer bugs and better IDE support.

Under the Hood
This project is built using:

React 18

TypeScript (strict mode)

Vite (for fast builds and development)

Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling)

react-table (for flexible table logic)

ESLint + Prettier (to keep the code clean and consistent)
